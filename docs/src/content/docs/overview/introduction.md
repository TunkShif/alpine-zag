description: Unstyled and accessible UI components for Alpine powered by Zag.
---

**Alpine Zag** is a collection of headless UI primitives as [AlpineJS][alpinejs] plugins. It provides a set of highly customizable, unstyled, and accessible UI components,
allowing you to easily build your own design system.

Under the hood, all components are powered by [ZagJS][zagjs]. Zag is a pretty cool project that models each UI component as a finite state machine to handle all UI interaction logics.
And **Alpine Zag** provides an easy way to consume the machine and connect it to your UI.

## Features

### Unstyled

Components have no predefined styles. You can use your preferred CSS tools to build your design system.
### Accessible

Components are built following the WAI-ARIA guidelines to provide accessible user experience, like keyboard navigation and focus management.

### Composible

Components can be used in a declarative way, allowing you to build complex UIs with ease.
